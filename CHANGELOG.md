# Changelog

## 0.5.41 — Localized navigation and site identity (August 2026)

- Fixed the shared navigation so its labels immediately follow the selected Arabic or English language on every catalogue and tool page.
- Added a parser-blocking language bootstrap before styles to prevent Arabic content flashing during English navigation.
- Localized the visible brand and accessible home label.
- Added a dedicated lightweight Adawaty SVG favicon across the home, catalogue, categories, tools and 404 page.
- Added regression coverage for language bootstrapping, navigation state and favicon paths.

## 0.5.40 — Image average & dominant color picker (July 2026)

- Added browser-local `image-average-color-picker`:
  - Average HEX + RGB from the full image (opaque pixels only).
  - Dominant palette (1–12 colors) via fast quantized sampling on a downscaled canvas.
  - Fully private: no upload, no new dependencies.
- Published tool page under `/tools/image-average-color-picker/`.
- Marked the ROADMAP item complete; next image gaps remain extractor/eyedropper/censor/SVG generators.
- Bumped package version to `0.5.40`.

## 0.5.39 — Pure client-side policy; retire server tools (July 2026)

### Policy
- Product catalogue is **browser-only** until a stable, disclosed server stack exists.
- Server-side PDF→Word Pro (`pdf2docx` / Vercel API path) is **retired from the public product** (page was already 404; residual bytecode cache removed).
- ROADMAP stage-3 (server/AI) tools stay deferred and must not ship in the main catalogue without explicit disclosure.

### Documentation
- Expanded `docs/ROADMAP.md` with competitive parity targets inspired by all-in-one toolboxes (10015.io, iLovePDF-style gaps) that remain feasible fully in-browser.
- Cleared outdated «Pro server ✅» matrix rows; marked Pro path as removed.
- Bumped package version to `0.5.39`.

### Cleanup
- Removed leftover `api/__pycache__/pdf-to-word.cpython-312.pyc`.

### Next recommended work (from ROADMAP)
- UX: richer `/all-tools/` search/filters; unified progress UI for heavy tools.
- Tools: `pdf-page-crop`, `pdf-blank-page-remover`, `image-average-color-picker`, `cron-expression-parser`, CSS generators gap-fill.

## 0.5.38 — Documentation, license & contribution foundation (July 2026)

### Done in this release
- Added **MIT License** (`LICENSE`).
- Added **CONTRIBUTING.md** with local setup, generate/validate workflow, and contribution principles.
- Updated **README.md**: correct live site URL (Vercel), contribution pointer, license section, and clearer overview.
- Cleaned encoding artifacts in historical CHANGELOG headings.
- Bumped package version to `0.5.38` and set `"license": "MIT"` in `package.json`.
- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` with UX/infrastructure priorities and last-update note so future contributors can continue without re-analysis.

### Analysis summary (for future work)
- Live site: https://adawaty-five.vercel.app/
- Curated catalogue: ~437 high-value tools across 19 categories (after retiring low-value calculators).
- Strengths: true client-side privacy for most tools, bilingual AR/EN, automated page generation, solid validation pipeline, conversion matrix coverage (audio / video / image / PDF / CSV↔Excel).

### Recommended next improvements (priority order)

#### High priority (UX & core)
- [ ] Enrich `/all-tools/` with real-time search, category filters, and tags (processing vs calculator).
- [ ] Unified progress / loading UI for FFmpeg, OCR, and large PDF/image jobs.
- [ ] Better bilingual error messages and empty states.
- [ ] Implement `pdf-page-crop` and `pdf-blank-page-remover`.

#### Medium priority
- [ ] Simple Service Worker / PWA support for offline use of popular tools.
- [ ] `cron-expression-parser`, `json-schema-validator`, `image-average-color-picker`.
- [ ] Improve homepage search with instant suggestions.

#### Lower priority / future
- [ ] Word → PDF (client-side quality limits noted in ROADMAP).
- [ ] AVIF support when browser coverage improves.
- [ ] PDF password protect/remove (blocked by current pdf-lib limitations).
- [ ] Optional server tools (background remover, AI upscaler) remain isolated with clear disclosure.

### Notes for contributors
- After any definition change: always run `npm run generate:product` then `npm run validate` before commit.
- ROADMAP remains the single source of truth for next tools.

## 0.5.36 — Navigation and catalogue quality

- Retired 86 low-value arithmetic, direct-formula, and media-metadata calculators while preserving scientific, health, finance, conversion, and processing tools.
- Reduced the bright homepage call-to-action contrast with a calmer dark gradient and accessible brand action.
- Regenerated the public catalogue, category pages, tool pages, and sitemap from the curated 437-tool registry.
